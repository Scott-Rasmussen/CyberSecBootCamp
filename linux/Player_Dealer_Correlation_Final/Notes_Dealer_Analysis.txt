##The Lucky Duck Casino was noticing suspicious losses at the roulette table on certain days in March.

##Raw data was pulled for the days of the losses and a list of the dealers working the days in
##quetion was complied by using the script Dealer_Schedule_Combined.sh

##This is the script used to compile Dealer schedule over multiple days.
#! /bin/bash

##script to compile all dealer's schedules over multiple days.

##Script Used - where $n is the schedule of the day in question.
grep -FH " " $1 > Dealer_Schedule_Combined.txt
grep -FH " " $2 >> Dealer_Schedule_Combined.txt
grep -FH " " $3 >> Dealer_Schedule_Combined.txt

##end script

##Once the file Dealer_Schedule_Combined.txt was created a script was made to winnow out the
##Roulette Dealer on the days in question.

##First the sed command was used on Roulette_Losses.txt (showing times of the losses on the
##days in question) to create the file Roulette_Losses_Amended.txt. The sed command replaced the string "win_loss_player_data"
##to "Dealer_schedule".

sed s/win_loss_player_data/Dealer_schedule/Roulette_Losses.txt > Roulette_Losses_Amended.txt

##This provided a file with data that could be run against Dealer_Schedule_Combine.txt

##The data collected from the Roulette_Losses_Amended.txt <newly formated date and time> was then inserted into the grep variable $n to run the script Suspicious_Roulette_Dealer.sh

##Script Suspicious_Roulette_Dealer.sh created to winnow out dealers working on days and times in question

#! /bin/bash

##initial script to understand pipe flow
cat Dealer_Schedule_Combined.txt | awk -F" " '{print ($1, $2, $5, $6)}' >  Suspicious_Roulette_Dealer1.txt | grep "$1" Suspicious_Roulette_Dealer1.txt > Suspicious_Roulette_Dealer_Combined.txt

$n = <xxxx_Dealer_schedule.txt:xx:xx:xx xx>

##final script where grep $n is the day/date/time data pulled from Roulette_Losses_Amended.txt, compared to the file
##Dealer_Schedule_Combined.txt and outputted as Suspicious_Roulette_Dealer_compined. 
cat Dealer_Schedule_Combined.txt | awk -F" " '{print ($1, $2, $5, $6)}' | grep "$1" > Suspicious_Roulette_Dealer_Combined.txt
cat Dealer_Schedule_Combined.txt | awk -F" " '{print ($1, $2, $5, $6)}' | grep "$2" >> Suspicious_Roulette_Dealer_Combined.txt

cat Dealer_Schedule_Combined.txt | awk -F" " '{print ($1, $2, $5, $6)}' | grep "$12" >> Suspicious_Roulette_Dealer_Combined.txt
cat Dealer_Schedule_Combined.txt | awk -F" " '{print ($1, $2, $5, $6)}' | grep "$13" >> Suspicious_Roulette_Dealer_Combined.txt
~                                                                                                                                      
##end script

##The final output is .txt document called Suspicious_Roulette_Dealer.txt (see attached) which tells us one major fact.
##We know from our analysis of the win_loss_player_data that there were 13 instances of losses over the three days in question.
##On every single day and time of the 13 instances where losses occured, the only Roulette Dealer to be working at those times was Billy Jones.
