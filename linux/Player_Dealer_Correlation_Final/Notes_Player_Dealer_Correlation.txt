There has been a suspicious amount of losses by the Roulette Table at the Lucky Duck Casino and an investigation was launched.

Utilizing the methodology laid out in the file Notes_Player_Analysis.txt it was established that there were 13 instances
of suspicious losses over the course of three non-consecutive days. The data showed that at theses times there was one player
 consistentlay present at all the times the losses occured. 

This payer was one Mylie Schmidt.

Now it could very well be that Mylie has been very lucky and on a "hot streak" at the table, though this is very unlikely
once other data is brought forth and analyzed.

The Notes_Dealer_Analysis.txt demonstrated the methodology used in order to see which dealers were working the Roulette Table 
when the instances of loss occured. Though The Lucky Duck Casino employs numerous Roulette Dealers there was a single individual
that worked the table every single time the losses occured.

This dealer was Billy jones.

Now there is the saying that correlation does not necessarily equal causation, but in this instance, the data speaks loud and clear.
That on the days and even times in qustion Dealer Billy Jones and
Player Mylie Schmidt are the only two consistent variables when looking at these losses.

It is recommended that further investigations on these two be initiated starting with a suspension of 
Mr. Jones and ban of Ms. Schmidt from entering the casino while the investigation is being conducted.
